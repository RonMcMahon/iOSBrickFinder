      "appDescription": "Welcome to the '88 Olympic Brick Finder.  This is the ONLY digital database of Calgary's Olympic Plaza Bricks.  Each of the 36,000+ bricks in the plaza is locatable with your phone's GPS capability.  You can also use the original 'between these two key bricks' location method.  The database of bricks has been painstakingly regenerated from 25-year old mainframe printer records as there was no digital copy of this database - until now!  If you happen to notice a mistake in our record, please let us know and we'll update our system.  Thanks for helping to keep Olympic Plaza and the bricks that are a key part of it an important part of Calgary's Olympic legacy!\n\nBe sure to visit us on the web at OLYMPICBRICKS.COM",
